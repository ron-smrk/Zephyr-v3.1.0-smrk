1 - No Power good for 3.3
  - PG_VDD_3R3 (Page 36) goes nowhere.
  - There is a line (PG_VDD_0R9_MGTYAVCC, pg42) which goes nowhere, was this supposed
    to be PG_VDD_3R3?

2 - EN_VDD_0r85 seems to do nothing, ie. no effect (PG_VDD_0R85 doesn't change).
    Turning rail 0 on/off via PMBus commands does allow OG signal to work.

3 - Xilinx Micro Doc/Schematic Inconsistencies
  - PA9 says tri-state, PD. There is no PD on schematic. Able to fix by GPIO setup. There is
    a PU marked NOSTUFF.
  - PA11 says tri-state, PD. There is no PD on schematic. Able to fix by GPIO setup.
  - PA12 says tri-state, PD. There is no PD on schematic. Able to fix by GPIO setup.
    Schematic says (BUILT IN PU)?

4 - Enable 0r6_vtt, maybe add a note saying 1.2_ddr must be on first.

5 - Document-schematic mismatch: VDD_0R9_MGTAVCC_PG in doc, PG_VDD_0R9_MGTACC on
    schematic, prefer schematic naming as other power good lines start with PG_

6 - PMIC_SDA, PMIC_SDL pulled up by VDD_3R3. This is needed to enable 1r8fpga, but 1r8fpga is
    enabled before 3r3.
    




-----------------------------------

EN_VDD_1R2_DDR enables MAX chip. Supplies VDD_1R2_DDR.
pmbus read to get voltage verify PG good set
PG_VDD_1R2_DDR comes from MAX chip. 


EN_VDD_1R2_MGTVTT goes to TPS22990DML, supplies VDD_1R2_MGTVTT
pmbus read of max, verifies input voltage good combined with PG to vedrify
PG_VDD_1R2_MGTVTT comes from TPS22990DML
