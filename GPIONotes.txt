1 - No Power good for 3.3
  - PG_VDD_3R3 (Page 36) goes nowhere.
  - There is a line (PG_VDD_0R9_MGTYAVCC, pg42) which goes nowhere, was this supposed
    to be PG_VDD_3R3?

2 - EN_VDD_0r85 seems to do nothing, ie. no effect (PG_VDD_0R85 doesn't change).
    Turning rail 0 on/off via PMBus commands does allow OG signal to work.

3 - Xilinx Micro Doc/Schematic Inconsistencies
  - PA9 says tri-state, PD. There is no PD on schematic. Able to fix by GPIO setup.
  - PA12 says tri-state, PD. There is no PD on schematic. Able to fix by GPIO setup.
    Schematic says (BUILT IN PU)?
  - PA11 says tri-state, PD. There is no PD on schematic. Able to fix by GPIO setup.

4 - Enable 0r6_vtt, maybe add a note saying 1.2_ddr must be on first.

5 - Document-schematic mismatch: VDD_0R9_MGTAVCC_PG in doc, PG_VDD_0R9_MGTACC on
    schematic, prefer schematic naming as other power good lines start with PG_
